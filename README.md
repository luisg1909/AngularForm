# Let's get started!
Introducing the "Employee Happiness Tracker" or HSFE, to speed things up.
HSFE, is an app that helps the user track the happiness level of people related to their company.
Each person will have the following properties: • Name
• Category (Employee or Manager)
⚫ Company name
⚫ Happiness level
We want it to list people and allow searching by name or category. The results should include
 the ability to sort them by happiness level, category or company in ascending or descending order.

We also want users to select which people to track, like a favorites list, to check how they are doing.
 We recommend displaying the favorites list within a modal that is easily accessible via the navigation bar.
In the favorites modal, I want to be able to search by name, category, and company and have the ability to remove people from the favorites list, without having to close it.
Try using pagination for listings! We recommend displaying 5 at a time.
# Delivery Requirements
You can use any strategy you prefer to store the favorites list and persistence is not required. 
You must attach your solution in a single zip file or provide them via a private git repository.
 The solution must run correctly and a text file with the necessary instructions to compile and/or run it must be provided.
# Additional Delivery (not required)
Any UX or UI improvements you wish to develop will be taken into account.
It would be great to know if you did not have time to complete the exercise or if you would do something
 differently if you had more time.
